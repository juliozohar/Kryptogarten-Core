# Kryptogarten-Core
Kryptogarten is a playground for coding, experimenting, learning, and exploring the blockchain technology. 

Even though the main use of this technology is enabling the use of cryptocurrencies, such as «Bitcoin», 
Kryptogarten's focus will be on other aspects of the blockchain, specially those enabling the use of Smart
Contract. Nevertheless, for the joy of learning, a cryptocurrency scheme may be implemented in experimental
mode in KG. 

Help is welcome. If you'd like to contribute with the project and learn along the way, check the file Changelog 
to take a look at the features we'll be delivering in this iteration. Fell free to branch it and make a
pull request! If you would like to get further involved, or would like to discuss other ideas, drop me a line 
at kryptogarten@gmail.com.
